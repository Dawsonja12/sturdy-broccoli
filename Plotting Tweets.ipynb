    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few months my news feed has been a constant wash of articles about Blockchain, stock markets (GME) and Elon Musk. The first and the last of these topics have been newsworthy regularly over the last few years, meanwhile the GME shortsqueeze appeared overnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no doubt that these topics are interconnected. Homebound US citizens with stimulus checks and too much time seem to be the main participants in these three hot topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst this has been going on I have found myself increasingly interested in data science, more specifically data visualisation, I was introduced to the field by a colleague and sites like ChartR (https://www.chartr.co/) have gone a long way in furthering that interest. Stories told through a simple vis are compelling. A picture (or chart) speak a thousand words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To attempt to get into the field I have been taking an extended course on data science provided by IBM. I found this course good, but lacking applied projects..so here goes an attempt at applying some of what I have known.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this post?\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't really written to garner an audience - more for me to catalogue my progress over what I hope will be a long while.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The project\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan is to look at the Bitcoin, Dogecoin and GME prices along side Mr Musks Twitter activity to see if I can see any trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted this is not a rigerous quantitative approach - more a high level 'lets see what I can achieve in a day or so and check what I've learned' approach. If you're after the former then have a look at this: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3778844"

    "### Quick note on obtaining tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "How would we obtain the tweet information? My initial thought process was:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scrape the tweets using the Twitter API \n",
    "- Create a table of the tweets with datestamp and text\n",
    "- Filter by keyword e.g. BTC, Bitcoin etc.\n",
    "- Plot the tweets using date stamp over the price graph \n",
    "\n",
    "this would likely involve appending prices to the table so that we can plot an effective 'x and y' coordinate of date and price and then use the text as a data label - that's the theory at least...\n",
    "\n",
    "In scraping the tweets I came across Tweepy, which is a convinient pre-made package that enables you to scrape tweets without too much prior knowledge. I ended up using it and an article from Martin Beck: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1 to achieve what I wanted. I won't claim I spent too much time examining what was going on in the next cell but I cared more that it worked, and really that's the beauty of the ds community - open knowledge sharing. It's what makes it approachable to a complete novice like myself. The cell below is far better explained by the article above so I won't go into much detail.\n",
